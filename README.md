## Purpose

There are times when you only want to use the excellent Bootstrap grid functionality but don't want the extra classes and typography changes included. With Bootstrap 4, extracting the grid functionality is easy.

### Included Features

* Grid framework (flex enabled)
* Responsive Utilities

## Usage

I have already taken the liberty of extracting the grid and responsive utilities mixins, which can be found in `dist/css/bootstrap-grid.css`. Simply download the CSS file and include it in your HTML header.

Documentation for the [grid framework](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/) and [responsive utilities](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/responsive-utilities/) may be found on the [Bootstrap 4 web site](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/).
